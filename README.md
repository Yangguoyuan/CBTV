# Welcome to the Computational Brain Template Variability (CBTV) repository

We are from Jia-Hong Gao’s Center for MRI Research (CMR).

CBTV repository is a package that provides following useful tools:

1.	Brain template variability algorithms based on deformation field.
2.	Brain size calculation.
3.	Brain tissue volume calculation.
4.	Tissue segmentation accuracy algorithms.

Currently, CBTV mainly uses matlab, bash, python and only supports Linux system.

# Usage

Happy researching!

# Others depend on
Data preprocessing using the ‘minimal preprocessing pipelines’ (Glasser et al., 2013), for more info, please see https://github.com/Washington-University/HCPpipelines/releases website. Template were constructed based on a diffeomorphic template building framework using the symmetric image normalization in ANT software (https://github.com/ANTsX/ANTs).
